# AllowList
# populate the collection of *available* Allows for the system.
# this allows an admin to edit them (and add more, usually).

# ActionAllows
# populate a collection of Action names and their required 'Allow's
# when the Actions are created at startup, they will connect themselves to
# this so they know which Allow(s) to use when they are run. they must listen
# for changes so they are updated when it's changed.

# Allows
# populate the Allows collection for the one default superuser.
